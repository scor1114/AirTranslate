AirTranslate captures audio playing on your Mac, turns it into a live transcript, translates it in real time, and can show the result as a floating caption overlay. It is designed for meetings, lectures, videos, interviews, and streams where routing audio through a microphone is awkward or lossy.

For a user-facing overview, setup guide, and download path, visit the [AirTranslate Guide Site](https://himomohi.github.io/AirTranslate/).

The default workflow uses Apple frameworks. GPT Realtime and Gemini Live Translate are optional API-backed modes and can be enabled from the app only after you provide the matching API key.

## Why AirTranslate

- **System-audio first:** capture Mac playback audio directly with ScreenCaptureKit.
- **Readable live workspace:** source and translated text stay side by side.
- **Floating captions:** keep subtitles above other apps while you watch or listen.
- **Apple by default:** Apple Speech and Apple Translation remain the baseline path.
- **Optional API modes:** OpenAI Realtime Translation and Gemini Live Translate can be enabled only when needed.
- **Keychain storage:** OpenAI and Gemini API keys are entered by the user and stored in macOS Keychain.
- **Plain text history:** saved transcripts remain normal `.txt` files in Application Support.

## What's New in 1.6.0

- **Optional audio recording, enabled by default:** While capture runs, the microphone or Mac audio is also saved as a compressed `.m4a` beside your transcripts. Turn it off with the **Save audio file** checkbox on the main screen; recordings never leave your Mac.
- **Recording-aware transcript library:** Recordings without transcript text appear as audio-only rows, deleting a transcript removes its paired recording, and the recording currently being written is protected from deletion.
- **More reliable GPT Live Transcribe:** Turn boundaries are driven by the app, audio is committed after 15 seconds regardless of input level, and an empty-commit rejection is recoverable instead of fatal.
- **Better stop behavior:** Stop shows a Stopping state, begins capture shutdown before draining transcription, and a second press ends the session immediately.
- **Live translation spacing fixed:** Provider turns are joined on segment boundaries, so translated text no longer runs together as `배송되고거기서`.

## What's New in 1.5.1

- **Minimal, consistent interface:** The workspace, sidebar, menu bar, floating captions, transcript library, and Settings now share one restrained system for spacing, icons, surfaces, selection, and hover feedback.
- **Clearer settings status:** Separate permission rows show the available state or direct you to verify it in System Settings, language assets expose download progress and retry states, and the About pane shows the app version and build.
- **More reliable settings controls:** Voice volume follows the voice-output state, API-key persistence uses one session-store path, startup checks Keychain presence without reading secret data or showing authentication UI, and floating-caption previews follow the selected display mode.
- **Keyboard and accessibility:** Settings preserve section identity while navigating, provide clearer accessibility labels and values, and respect Reduce Motion.

See the complete [AirTranslate 1.5.1 release notes](https://github.com/scor1114/AirTranslate/releases/tag/v1.5.1).

## What's New in 1.5.0

- **Apple Mode lifecycle hardening:** Apple Mode remains the default local-first path and now ignores late permission, warm-up, and capture callbacks from an older start attempt.
- **Clean external stops:** stopping macOS system-audio capture outside the app now saves the transcript, unlocks the session, and permits a clean restart.
- **No silent speech-input loss:** audio backpressure becomes a visible controlled stop instead of silently dropping input.
- **Optional GPT Transcription:** choose `gpt-live-transcribe` for source-only captions only when you provide an OpenAI API key; it is separate from GPT live translation.

See the complete [AirTranslate 1.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/scor1114/AirTranslate/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

## What's New in 1.4.2

- **Reliable microphone permission prompt:** signed local and release builds now embed the macOS microphone audio-input entitlement required for permission requests.
- **Release-signing guard:** packaging checks verify Hardened Runtime, the release/debug entitlement split, and the microphone permission description before distribution.

See the complete [AirTranslate 1.4.2 release notes](https://github.com/scor1114/AirTranslate/releases/tag/v1.4.2).

## What's New in 1.4.1

- **Steadier translated speech:** Apple Mode now waits for stable sentence boundaries before speaking streaming translated text.
- **Final text still speaks:** final translations that arrive without punctuation are spoken when the translation request completes.
- **Fewer repeated tails:** restored sentence tails, near-duplicate finalization variants, and short repeated suffixes are suppressed instead of being spoken again.
- **Cleaner dubbing handoff:** enabling translated speech no longer rereads translation text that was already visible.
- **Legitimate repeats preserved:** repeated phrases can still be spoken later in a session after the short replay window expires.
- **Focused regression coverage:** the translated-speech progress logic is covered by dedicated AirTranslateCore tests.

See the complete [AirTranslate 1.4.1 release notes](https://github.com/scor1114/AirTranslate/releases/tag/v1.4.1).

## Processing Modes

AirTranslate separates the quick choice from the detailed setup.

| Mode | Best For | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Mode | Local-first transcription and translation | Uses Apple Speech for transcription and Apple Translation for the selected language pair. Source-language auto-detect is temporarily disabled while language-switch handling is improved. |
| GPT Mode | OpenAI Realtime live translation | Streams audio directly to OpenAI Realtime Translation. If no API key is saved, AirTranslate opens the settings modal and focuses the API key field. |
| GPT Transcription | OpenAI source-only captions | Uses `gpt-live-transcribe` for source-language captions without translation after you choose this optional mode and provide an OpenAI API key. |
| Gemini Live | Gemini 3.5 Live Translate | Streams audio directly to Gemini Live Translate and shows the returned input and translated transcripts. If no Gemini API key is saved, AirTranslate opens the settings modal and focuses the key field. |
| Transcribe Only | Source captions without translation | Records source-language captions without running translation. |
| LIVE Translation | Direct translated stream | Uses the selected API provider's live translation model path when you want the model to produce the translated stream directly. |

GPT/Gemini model details, API key entry, transcript polish, and voice output are managed from the gear-shaped settings modal. The main sidebar only exposes the most important choices.

## Privacy And API Keys

AirTranslate does not ship with a backend account system.

- Apple Mode uses macOS frameworks and locally managed Apple language assets.
- OpenAI calls happen only when GPT Mode or the optional GPT Transcription mode is enabled.
- Gemini calls happen only when Gemini Live mode is enabled.
- OpenAI and Gemini API keys are never hardcoded, committed, or included in release packages.
- Keys are saved in macOS Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`.
- Saved transcripts are plain text files on your Mac.

Need an API key? Open the [OpenAI API key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [Google AI Studio API key page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), create a key, then paste it into AirTranslate's settings modal.

## Apple Translation Language Packs

Apple Mode uses macOS-managed translation languages. Before using Apple Mode with a new language pair, download the needed Apple translation language packs:

1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **General > Language & Region**.
3. Click **Translation Languages**.
4. Click **Download** for each source and target language you want to use.
5. Optional: turn on **On-Device Mode** if you want macOS to process supported translations on your Mac whenever possible.

If a selected language pair is unavailable or not downloaded, Apple Mode translation may not start or may show an unavailable state until macOS has the required language assets.

## Permissions

AirTranslate asks for the permissions required by its capture and transcription flow.

- Screen Recording
- System Audio Recording
- Microphone (only when microphone input is selected)
- Speech Recognition

Screen Recording is required because ScreenCaptureKit provides the system-audio capture path. AirTranslate does not save screen frames as recordings.

After changing macOS privacy permissions, quit and relaunch the app so the signed app bundle receives the new authorization state.
