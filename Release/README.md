# AirTranslate Open Source Release Kit

This folder contains reproducible release materials for the Apache 2.0 open-source AirTranslate project.

## What This Adds

- A repeatable local app-bundle and ZIP build script.
- Screenshot and README assets for GitHub releases and project documentation.
- A privacy notice draft aligned with the current local-first app behavior.
- Version history for public source releases.

## Assumptions

- The app name remains `AirTranslate`.
- The bundle identifier is `dev.appcaster.AirTranslate`.
- The current release-candidate version comes from `script/app_metadata.sh`.
- The project is published as Apache 2.0 open source.
- AirTranslate is an independent project and is not affiliated with Apple, OpenAI, Google, Meta, or Microsoft.
- The release bundle must never include user API keys, bearer tokens, signing private keys, provisioning profiles, or local `.env` files.

Override the defaults when needed:

```bash
BUNDLE_ID="com.example.AirTranslate" VERSION="1.8.0" BUILD_NUMBER="180"
```

## Local Release Build

This creates an ad-hoc signed app bundle and ZIP for local inspection or attaching to a GitHub release.

```bash
./Release/build_open_source_release.sh
```

To build a DMG for the pre-notarization GitHub Release install path:

```bash
./Release/build_open_source_release.sh dmg
```

To build both ZIP and DMG artifacts:

```bash
./Release/build_open_source_release.sh all
```

Outputs:

```text
Release/product/AirTranslate.app
Release/product/AirTranslate-<version>-<build>.zip
Release/product/AirTranslate-<version>.zip
Release/product/AirTranslate.dmg
Release/product/AirTranslate.dmg.sha256
Release/product/AirTranslate-<version>.dmg
Release/product/AirTranslate-<version>.dmg.sha256
```

`Release/product/` is generated output and should stay out of commits.

## 1.8.0 Apple Caption, Azure MAI, And Transcript Privacy Notes

- Public docs must describe **Save Transcript Files** as off by default. Stop and app quit do not create `.txt` files unless the user enables file saving in Settings > Transcript.
- Public docs must describe Azure MAI as a preview, optional provider mode that uses a user-provided Azure Speech endpoint and API key, sends 5-second segments to Azure Speech MAI-Transcribe-2, translates captions with Apple Translation, and may incur separate Azure charges.
- Do not claim Azure accuracy, latency, quota, region support, or real cloud audio success unless a configured Azure resource has been verified in the same release run.
- Public docs must describe Apple Mode preservation of short final utterances and repeated sentences using audio segment identity, while avoiding a blanket performance-speedup claim.
- Public docs must say Stage rewrites are held briefly for readability while first text and appended text still appear immediately, and that floating-caption stale translation expiry is calculated from the request deadline.
- Public docs must mention transcript pane copy controls being reachable through pointer, keyboard, and accessibility focus.
- The README semantic gate for 1.8.0 lives in `docs/release/1.8.0-readme-content-gate.md`, with the executable audit input in `docs/release/README-CONTENT-CHECKS-1.8.0.env`.

## 1.7.1 Floating Caption Stability Notes

- Public docs must describe Caption Stability (Responsive / Balanced / Steady) and Caption Alignment (Center / Left) as Settings and menu-bar controls for the floating overlay.
- Floating translations hold the previous translation until a replacement is ready; do not describe the overlay as clearing to a blank line on every rewrite.
- Floating captions reserve a fixed caption height so the source line does not jump when the translation appears or wraps.

## 1.7.0 Stage, Meta Scribe, And Long-Session Notes

- Public docs must describe Meta Scribe as optional Muse Voice Transcribe that sends audio only after the user enables it and provides a Meta API key.
- The main window is Stage & Console: turn-based caption blocks plus a floating console bar. Do not describe a settings sidebar as the live control surface.
- Apple Mode long-session copy must say the live line rolls over into a new turn block after roughly 600 committed characters or a long silence, and that saved transcripts still contain the full session when transcript file saving is enabled.
- Stage rendering is bounded to the 12 most recent turn blocks so the feed cannot go blank after a long session or stop/start.

## Secret Safety Gate

Before committing or uploading a release candidate, run a secret scan over the source tree and current diff. The app may mention `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a Keychain account name, but it must not contain a real key value, bearer credential, signing private key, provisioning profile, or `.env` file.

Suggested local checks:

```bash
rg -n --hidden --glob '!.git/**' --glob '!.build/**' --glob '!Release/product/**' \
  -i 'bearer|private key|client secret|access token|refresh token|api key' .

git diff -- . ':(exclude).build/**' ':(exclude)Release/product/**' | \
  rg -n -i 'bearer|private key|client secret|access token|refresh token|api key'
```

## Public Release Checklist

- Confirm `swift build` passes.
- Confirm `swift test` passes.
- Confirm the release ZIP contains `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.
- Confirm the release DMG opens and contains `AirTranslate.app` plus the Applications shortcut.
- Confirm `AirTranslate.dmg.sha256` matches the uploaded DMG.
- Confirm the release ZIP does not contain API keys, tokens, private keys, provisioning profiles, or `.env` files.
- Confirm OpenAI GPT mode still requires a user-provided key at runtime and does not bundle one.
- Confirm Gemini Live mode still requires a user-provided key at runtime and does not bundle one.
- Confirm Meta Scribe mode still requires a user-provided key at runtime and does not bundle one.
- Confirm Azure MAI still requires a user-provided Azure Speech endpoint and API key at runtime and does not bundle one.
- Confirm `Release/product/` remains ignored.
- Confirm all four public READMEs and `GITHUB-RELEASE-1.8.0.md` describe every 1.8.0 public theme with equivalent meaning: transcript file saving opt-in, Azure MAI preview and billing boundary, Apple short/repeated speech preservation, readable Stage/floating rewrite timing, keyboard/accessibility copy focus, and live-provider verification limits.
- Publish the new GitHub Release without deleting previous release versions or tags.
