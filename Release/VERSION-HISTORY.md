# AirTranslate Version History

## 1.8.0 - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Azure MAI preview mode sends 5-second audio chunks to Azure Speech MAI-Transcribe-2 with a user-provided Azure Speech endpoint and API key, then translates captions through Apple Translation.
- Apple caption pipeline coverage now includes segment metadata, repeated final utterances, stale recognition rejection, bounded partial translation requests, and Stage rewrite presentation.

### Changed

- Transcript file saving is opt-in. Stop and app quit do not write `.txt` files unless **Save Transcript Files** is enabled in Settings > Transcript.
- Apple Mode now preserves audio segment identity and final-result revisions through recognition, translation, display, and saved transcript staging.
- Stage caption rewrites wait briefly before replacing readable text, while first text and appended text still appear immediately. Floating-caption stale translation expiry is calculated from the request deadline.

### Fixed

- Short final utterances and repeated sentences are preserved instead of being collapsed into nearby partial or final results.
- Transcript pane copy buttons remain discoverable through keyboard and accessibility focus.

## 1.7.1 - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Caption Stability (Responsive / Balanced / Steady) and Caption Alignment (Center / Left) in Settings and the menu bar.

### Changed

- Floating captions reserve a fixed caption height and fade replacements in one piece so the source line does not jump.

### Fixed

- Floating translations hold the previous translation until a replacement is ready, instead of rewriting or flickering on every recognizer revision.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Optional Meta Scribe mode powered by Muse Voice Transcribe adds realtime transcription, speaker labels, and 25-language code-switching before AirTranslate's existing translation layer. A user-provided Meta API key is required; Apple Mode remains the local-first default.

### Changed

- The main window is now a Stage & Console layout: live captions fill the window as turn-based blocks, and a floating console bar holds Start/Stop, audio source, language route, output mode, voice output, and the active engine. The settings sidebar is gone.
- A shared Air teal design system covers listening/paused/stopped colors, layered surfaces, and caption typography across the main window, Settings, transcript library, floating captions, and menu bar.
- Custom controls use an accent-colored focus ring, Start receives initial focus, and session-locked controls stay dimmed with a single lock indicator.

### Fixed

- Apple Mode no longer accumulates the entire session into one caption line. It rolls the live line into a new turn block after roughly 600 committed characters or a long silence, and late final results that revise a rolled sentence merge instead of duplicating. Saved transcripts still contain the full session.
- The Stage no longer goes blank after a long session or a stop/start cycle. The feed renders the 12 most recent turn blocks with a plain stack so rendering cost stays constant.

## 1.6.2 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- AirTranslate requests Screen Recording access only on the first necessary attempt; later failures show the existing macOS Privacy & Security recovery path without reopening the system request.
- Permission guidance now tells users to keep only the intended AirTranslate installation because older or differently signed copies with the same bundle identifier can create conflicting TCC identities.
- Public DMG and ZIP artifacts remain ad-hoc signed, so TCC permission inheritance is not guaranteed between updates and the newly installed build may need to be confirmed in System Settings.
- The hidden Settings Scene no longer participates in capture-start segmented-control state changes, preventing its disabled `Picker` from entering an AppKit focus-navigation/AttributeGraph CPU loop and allowing the top Gemini Live Start flow to proceed.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- The top Start control now begins Gemini Live capture with the selected Gemini mode.
- Segmented capture controls no longer use AppKit's dynamic disabled state during startup, avoiding its focus-navigation/AttributeGraph CPU loop while retaining the visible locked state.
- Start failures now remain in the main window with an appropriate API-key Settings, macOS Privacy Settings, or retry action instead of disappearing as a transient overlay.
- Local launch verification checks the exact executable inside the current `dist/AirTranslate.app`, so an older same-bundle-ID copy cannot be reported as the active build.
- Permission guidance identifies the current signed AirTranslate build and asks for one targeted Settings refresh only when macOS does not recognize it; routine TCC resets are not required.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Optional Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live for original-only captions with automatic spoken-language detection when the user supplies a Gemini API key.

### Changed

- Gemini Live now handles finished session state, scheduled session resumption, GoAway reconnection recommendations, bounded context compression, and 40 ms audio transmission for more resilient long-running capture.
- The workspace and Settings reflow at the minimum window size without hiding controls, and Apple, GPT, and Gemini transcription modes share the same original-only output behavior.

### Fixed

- Original-only transcription no longer leaves translated-voice controls or target-language routing visible.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Per-permission rows with available status or System Settings verification guidance, refreshable permission state, translation-asset download progress/error/retry feedback, and visible app version/build details.

### Changed

- The workspace, sidebar, menu bar, floating captions, transcript library, and Settings now share a minimal design system with consistent spacing, icon sizing, surfaces, selection, and hover feedback.
- Settings communicate API-key replacement, active control dependencies, caption-preview behavior, keyboard navigation, accessibility values, and Reduce Motion behavior more clearly.

### Fixed

- Voice volume is no longer interactive while translated voice output is unavailable or off.
- API-key persistence uses one session-store path instead of duplicate Settings-level Keychain writes.
- Startup API-key presence checks no longer read secret data or allow authentication UI before the first window appears.
- The About pane resolves version/build metadata from the packaged executable that is actually running.
- Failed translation-language assets can be retried, and each Settings section retains a stable scroll identity.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Added optional GPT Transcription with `gpt-live-transcribe` for source-only live captions when the user provides an OpenAI API key. Apple Mode remains the default local-first path.
- Added lifecycle regression tests for permission cancellation, stale callbacks, external system-audio stops, restart behavior, configuration locking, and explicit speech-input backpressure handling.

### Changed

- Apple Mode start attempts now use generation-scoped ownership so an old permission, warm-up, or callback cannot mutate a newer capture session.

### Fixed

- An external system-audio user stop now saves the active transcript, unlocks the session, and allows the next start to proceed normally.
- Speech-input backpressure is surfaced as a controlled stop instead of silently losing audio.
- Stale OpenAI and Gemini connection errors can no longer replace the current session state or expose raw provider connection details in the UI.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Release and local app signatures now embed the required microphone audio-input entitlement while retaining Hardened Runtime.
- The privacy-reset helper now resets Microphone permission, and packaging checks verify the release/debug entitlement separation before distribution.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Apple-mode translated speech now waits for stable sentence boundaries during streaming and speaks final unpunctuated translations immediately when the request completes.
- Dubbing speech progress is isolated in AirTranslateCore with focused regression coverage for streaming rewrites, finalization revisions, suffix replays, priming, and repeat expiry.

### Fixed

- Prevented translated speech from repeating the tail of a restored sentence after a shorter streaming rewrite.
- Suppressed near-duplicate finalization variants and text that was already visible before dubbing was enabled.
- Prevented short suffix replays while keeping legitimate later repeated phrases speakable.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Periodic transcript checkpoints during active capture and native macOS capture shortcuts.
- Regression tests for long-session responsiveness, realtime provider tails, retry policies, floating-window visibility, and speech backlog limits.

### Changed

- Apple basic mode now bounds long-session MainActor work with automatic update coalescing, background translation preparation, and a bounded LRU cache.
- Gemini Live uses explicit activity detection and bounded pre-setup audio buffering.
- OpenAI translation streams partial results and applies bounded retry and timeout behavior.
- Workspace, sidebar, menu bar, floating-caption, and settings interactions have clearer state, keyboard, accessibility, and reduced-motion behavior.

### Fixed

- Preserved the final buffered words across realtime completion, pause, stop, and termination paths.
- Prevented translated speech and realtime audio queues from accumulating unbounded stale output.
- Restored off-screen floating caption windows to a visible display.
- Redacted authenticated Gemini WebSocket details from network errors shown to users.

## 1.3.6 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Gemini 3.5 Live Translate mode for direct audio-to-live-translation sessions.
- Gemini API key storage in macOS Keychain.
- Compact LIVE Translation control for API-backed GPT and Gemini modes.
- Sidebar voice-output toggle and translated-voice volume slider.

### Changed

- GPT mode now uses OpenAI Realtime Translation for the live translation path and shows source transcript updates.
- API-backed modes now use one translated-audio output path and default voice output on.
- Apple basic mode defaults voice output off while allowing manual translated speech output.
- Settings and sidebar controls now separate Apple, GPT Realtime, and Gemini Live modes more clearly.

### Fixed

- Source-language quick changes no longer switch translation sessions to Transcribe Only mode.
- GPT realtime translation now shows the original transcript.
- GPT and Gemini live translated audio playback now uses the translated voice path consistently.
- Apple basic-mode translated speech no longer lowers the Mac system volume.

## 1.3.5 - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Saved transcript history now loads lightweight previews first and opens full text only when a transcript is selected.
- Realtime GPT transcript updates are coalesced to reduce MainActor and UI churn during long sessions.
- Realtime audio send backlog is bounded so stalled network sends cannot accumulate without limit.
- Start/stop capture teardown is serialized before a new capture start.

### Fixed

- Very large transcript panes now render a bounded display tail even in standard session mode while preserving the full saved text.

## 1.3.4 - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Floating caption wrapping now scales with the selected text size so larger captions keep readable text within the floating window.

## 1.3.3 - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added a dedicated Transcribe Only output mode that shows only the original transcript pane.

### Changed

- Floating captions keep the wrapping improvements from 1.3.2-era development and stay original-only during Transcribe Only sessions.
- Transcribe Only language changes now keep the hidden target language aligned with the visible source language.

### Fixed

- Prevented blank translation-only floating captions while Transcribe Only mode is active.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Centered the empty transcript placeholder in the main workspace.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-05-16

### Changed

## 1.2.1 - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Apple mode now keeps the visible mode and internal translation state aligned.
- GPT mode setup now uses the same session-level mode switching path as Apple mode.

### Fixed

- Fixed Apple default mode translation staying inactive while transcription continued.
- Translation unavailable states now show a clear message in the translation output.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-05-13
